   <p class="doc">Researchers in Australia have created ground-breaking technology that allows autonomous vehicles to track running pedestrians and cyclists who are masked by larger cars, trucks, and buses.The autonomous car employs game-changing technology to "see" the world around it, including X-ray vision that overcomes blind areas to detect pedestrians and bicycles concealed by fast-moving vehicles.The iMOVE Cooperative Research Centre-funded project collaborates with the Australian Centre for Field Robotics and Australian Robotics at the University of Sydney.Vehicles can communicate what they "see" with others employing vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication using roadside ITS information-sharing units equipped with additional sensors such as cameras and lidar ("ITS stations").</p>
